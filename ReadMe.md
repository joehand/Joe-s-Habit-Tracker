This habit tracker uses [Meteor](http://meteor.com). It is an extension of the To-Do list tutorial provided on the site.

##Using Meteor

Meteor is pretty simple to set up. You'll need to install it on your machine: 

	$ curl https://install.meteor.com | sh

Then navigate to the Habit Tracker local repository and start it up!

	$ meteor 

Simple! The site should be running on `localhost:3000` now. 


##Habit Tracker 

I extended the To-Do example to user habits and dates. Each Todo became a habit with a history associated with it. You can check it off for the day or add a previous date in. 

The implementation is very basic right now. In the near future I will add real users and finish making a nice UI. 

Futher down the road I'd like some nicer interaction with the calendar.

And finally, more statistics and analysis!
